Script: Tuple_L00170964.py
By: L00170964
Purpose: To demostrate usage of tuple in python
Prerequisites: Read lecturer note "Walkthroughs - 3. Data Structures"
Tested: on Python v3.10.7 under Windows 11
Revision History:
Alpha version: 28SEPT22
Notes:
Tuples are immutable i.e. cannot remove/append/update items in a tuple.

# How many times a item appears in a tuple
print("Counting item ABC in tuple : ",tuple_01.count("ABC"))
# To find the index of the given item

# To print last item of the tuple
print("Last item in tuple : ",tuple_01[-1])
# To print iteams based on index range
print("Print range of items in tuple : ",tuple_01[2:5])
# Concatenate tuple
concatenate_tuple = tuple_01 + tuple_02

# To confirm tuples are immutable. Below line will throw TypeError
