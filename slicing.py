Notes:
A programme to slice strings in python
'''
string = "Greetings"
print("Value of string : ", string)
# To extract characters from the string, in the format [start:stop:step]
print("Slicing first four characters : ", string[0:4:1])
# Reverse indexing example
print("Slicing last four character : ", string[-1:-5:-1])
# To grab a single character 
print("Slicing sixth character : ", string[5])
# Slice the string and reassemble a new string with changes

# Example to demostrate string and a number are of different types
